# AmazonSmileRedirect

A real simple Tapermonkey script which redirects from https://www.amazon.* to https://smile.amazon.*.

For example: If you call https://www.amazon.com/FooBar it redirects you to https://smile.amazon.com/FooBar.
The same will happen if you visit the German (.de), British (.co.uk) or another national Amazon page.

2. Install this script ...
   1. ... from [GreaseFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/429592-amazon-smile-redirect)
      by pressing the install button
   2. ... or directly from this repository by copy the raw content of the
      `tapermonkeyScript.js` file and paste it to Tapermonkey.

## Usage

Open your Amazon domain which supports AmazonSmile (for example https://www.amazon.com).
This script automatically redirects you to the AmazonSmile subdomain.
