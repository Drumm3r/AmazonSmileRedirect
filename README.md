# AmazonSmileRedirect

A real simple Tapermonkey script which redirects from https://www.amazon.* to https://smile.amazon.*. 

For example: If you call https://www.amazon.com/FooBar it redirects you to https://smile.amazon.com/FooBar.
The same will happen if you visit the German (.de), British (.co.uk) or another national Amazon page.
